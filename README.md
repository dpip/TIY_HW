How I might explain The Iron Yard...

The Iron Yard is a 3 month immersive software bootcamp.
Peter Barth, the CEO of The Iron Yard, began an accelerator in Greenville, SC, <br> 
seeking to fill a void - start up support for tech in an area that was dear to him. <br> 
He was soon joined by Eric Dodds and, software engineer, Mason Stewart. <br> 
Mason had been teaching free classes for children and sought out the accelerator <br> 
to teach more classes in. They soon discovered a problem they could help solve: <br> 
the need for quality developers in the area. They gathered support and fundraising <br> 
from several tech companies, merged with <br> a greenville based software camp, and thus <br>
The Iron Yard Was Born. They, from the beginning, sought to provide a non-conventional, <br> 
genuine, immersive education in three months time and provide engineers for the local market. 
In 2013, John Saddington, pushed for expansion outside of the South Carolina Borders. <br>
The Iron Yard now has 20 active campuses.
