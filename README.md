How I might explain The Iron Yard...

    The Iron Yard is a 3 month immersive software bootcamp.
Peter Barth, the CEO of The Iron Yard, began an accelerator in Greenville, SC, <br> 
seeking to fill a void - start up support for tech in an area that was dear to him. <br> 
He was soon joined by Eric Dodds and, software engineer, Mason Stewart. <br> 
Mason had been teaching free classes for children and sought out the accelerator <br> 
to teach more classes in. They soon discovered a problem they could help solve: <br> 
the need for quality developers in the area. They gathered support and fundraising <br> 
from several tech companies, merged with <br> a greenville based software camp, and thus <br>
The Iron Yard Was Born. They, from the beginning, sought to provide a non-conventional, <br> 
genuine, immersive education in three months time and provide engineers for the local market. 
In 2013, John Saddington, pushed for expansion outside of the South Carolina Borders. <br>
The Iron Yard now has 20 active campuses.

_"Hey, my name is Jen and I've been doing some research on code schools in the area. <br> 
HackerSchool is $2000 less than your program, and allows for part time. Why choose TIY?"

    While part time may work for some, I found that an immersive environment suited me and <br>
I believe whole hearted it is the best way to learn a new language. Imagine if you were <br>
dropped off in Beijing with no knowledge of the language... you'd learn mandarin much faster <br>
and and have a much more thorough grasp of it than you were if you were taking your time <br> 
with a book back in the states. Iron Yard Students approach self-education, and they are <br>
empowered in both method and mentorship during and after their experience. As for the money, <br>
I would rather spend 2,000 more for the career placement, immersive environment, and quality <br>
of education / instructors. Also... I'd rather get a job after 3 months and spend that extra 3 <br>
making a lot more than part time for 6. You'll definitely make that 2,000 back and receive a much <br>
more thorough understanding of software engineering in the process.
